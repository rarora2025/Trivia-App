Process to Edit Questions:

- Hosted API (running currently)
1) Run main.py on terminal --> input questions and topic and it will copy a json to your clipboard
2) Paste new json into api --> https://www.npoint.io/docs/149c04583ba0a8ceefe2
3) Save 

- Manual JSON
1) Run main.py on terminal --> input questions and topic and it will save the resulting json to data.json file
2) Update the code (in script.js) so that the questions are fetching from data.json rather than the api link (switch commented lines)
3) Upload new data.json to github
